RadElements are powerful tools in documenting, communicating, and undersatnding radiology findings. However, as seen with prior standard ontologies, communicating these elements in standardized ways is equally as important to garuntee true interopability.

These are sample message showing how to communicate RadElement CDEs with all of the commonly use and acceptabed health care interopabilty standards:

- DICOM SR
- DICOMWeb
- HL7 v2
- FHIR

DSI aims to standardize communication across all existing standards, not just specific domains; to ensure the reach and effect of radiology findings throughout patient care.
