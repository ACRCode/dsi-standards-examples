RadElement CDEs are powerful tools to document, communicate, and utilize radiology findings. However, as seen with prior medical ontologies, communicating elements in standardized methods is equally as important to ensure true interoperability.

These are sample message showing how to communicate RadElement CDEs with all the commonly used and accepted health care interoperability standards:

- DICOM SR
- DICOMWeb
- HL7 v2
- FHIR

DSI aims to standardize communication across all existing standards, not just specific domains; to ensure the reach and effect of radiology findings throughout patient care.
